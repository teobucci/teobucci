### Hi there 👋

I'm Teo Bucci and I'm a Statistical Learning student at Politecnico di Milano.

My studies are focused on Machine Learning and Statistical Learning, leveraging both classical statistics methods and modern architectures.

🎓 **Education:**

 - Master of Science in Statistical Learning track of Mathematical Engineering at `Politecnico di Milano`
 - Alta Scuola Politecnica (Politecnico di Milano Honor Program)
 - Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Engineering at `Politecnico di Milano`

📌 **Some interesting projects:**

- [`Plants Species Classifier`](https://github.com/teobucci/CNN-Plants-Classifier): exploited deep neural networks to perform image classification and develop an ensemble model from pretrained state-of-the-art CNNs through transfer learning.
- [`Estimating Clients' Needs using Machine Learning`](https://github.com/teobucci/Fintech-Project): exploited machine learning techniques to create a cross-platform web-app to recommend products based on clients' needs.
- [`Study Plan Maker`](https://github.com/teobucci/compilatore-piano-di-studi): a linear programming web-app to simulate the best study plan for Mathematical Engineering students.
- [`Statistical analysis on biomechanical parameters`](https://github.com/teobucci/progetto-inferenza-statistica): linear regression for forecasting biomechanical parameters of the spine and ANOVA.
- Lecture notes for the courses of [`Model Identification`](https://github.com/teobucci/mida), [`Continuum Mechanics`](https://github.com/teobucci/meccanica-dei-continui), [`Automation Controls`](https://github.com/teobucci/fondamenti-di-automatica), [`Physics 1`](https://github.com/teobucci/fisica-1), [`Physics 2`](https://github.com/teobucci/fisica-2), [`Partial Differential Equations`](https://github.com/teobucci/edp-analitica), [`Calculus 3`](https://github.com/teobucci/analisi-tre) of the Mathematical Engineering degree.

🧠 **About me:**

- 🎞️ Favourite movie: _Treasure Planet_, R. Clements and J. Musker
- 🏋🏼 I consistently work out, and I've been a triple jumper for 5+ years
- 📚 I love writing in 📖 $\LaTeX$ 📖 to the point that I published a [book of my Numerical Analysis lecture notes](https://www.fubinitonelli.it/numerica/)
- 🌱 I've been a social media manager for Fridays For Future at national level
- 🎥 I've been practising videomaking and photography for over 8 years
