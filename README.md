# Hey folks 👋

I'm Teo Bucci, Mathematical Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano.
My studies are focused on Machine Learning and Statistical Learning, leveraging both classical statistics methods and modern architectures.

## 🎓 **Education**

 - Bachelor / Master of Science Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano
 - Alta Scuola Politecnica (Politecnico di Milano Honor Program)

## 📌 **Some interesting projects**

- [`Nonparametric Analysis of US Dairy Production and Consumption`](https://github.com/SmearyTundra/nonparametric-analysis-US-dairy-production-consumption): Analysis of US Dairy Market dynamics from 1985 to 2021. Developed models using nonparametric statistical methods such as GAMs, bootstrap, conformal prediction, spatial analysis and Bayesian clustering to identify best operating areas, pricing strategy and trending products.
- [`Stochastic Block Model Prior with Ordering Constraints for Gaussian Graphical Models`](https://github.com/teobucci/bayesian-statistics-project): Developed a Gibbs Sampler from scratch. In a Bayesian framework, a flexible new prior for Gaussian Graphical Models is proposed to allow learning a conditional dependence (block) structure among variables, taking into account ordering constraints.
- [`Plants Species Classifier`](https://github.com/teobucci/CNN-Plants-Classifier): exploited deep neural networks to perform image classification and develop an ensemble model from pretrained state-of-the-art CNNs through transfer learning.
- [`Estimating Clients' Needs using Machine Learning`](https://github.com/teobucci/Estimating-Clients-Needs-using-Machine-Learning): exploited machine learning techniques to create a cross-platform web-app to recommend products based on clients' needs.
- [`Study Plan Maker`](https://github.com/teobucci/compilatore-piano-di-studi): a linear programming web-app to simulate the best study plan for Mathematical Engineering students.

## 🧠 **About me**

- 🎞️ Favourite movie: _Treasure Planet_, R. Clements and J. Musker
- 🏋🏼 I consistently work out, and I've been a triple jumper for 5+ years
- 📚 I love writing in 📖 $\LaTeX$ 📖 to the point that I published a [book of my Numerical Analysis lecture notes](https://www.fubinitonelli.it/numerica/)
- 🌱 I've been a social media manager for Fridays For Future at national level
- 🎥 I've been practising videomaking and photography for over 8 years
