### Hi there 👋

I'm Teo Bucci and I'm a Statistical Learning student at Politecnico di Milano.

My studies are focused on Machine Learning and Statistical Learning, leveraging both classical statistics methods and modern architectures.

🎓 **Education:**
 - Master of Science in Statistical Learning track of Mathematical Engineering at `Politecnico di Milano`
 - Alta Scuola Politecnica (Politecnico di Milano Honor Program)
 - Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Engineering at `Politecnico di Milano`

📌 **Projects:**
- [Study Plan Maker](https://github.com/teobucci/compilatore-piano-di-studi): a linear programming web-app to simulate the best study plan for Maths Engineering students
- [Dominion Elo Calculator](https://github.com/teobucci/dominion-elo): a web-app for analysis of elo scores in [dominion.games](https://dominion.games/)
- [Statistical Inference Course Project](https://github.com/teobucci/progetto-inferenza-statistica): linear regression for forecasting biomechanical parameters of the spine
- LaTeX notes for the courses of [Model Identification](https://github.com/teobucci/mida), [Continuum Mechanics](https://github.com/teobucci/meccanica-dei-continui), [Automation Controls](https://github.com/teobucci/fondamenti-di-automatica), [Physics 1](https://github.com/teobucci/fisica-1), [Physics 2](https://github.com/teobucci/fisica-2), [Partial Differential Equations](https://github.com/teobucci/edp-analitica), [Calculus 3](https://github.com/teobucci/analisi-tre) of the Mathematical Engineering degree

Moreover...
- 🏋🏼 I consistently work out, and I've been a triple jumper for 5+ years
- 📚 I love writing in 📖 $\LaTeX$ 📖 to the point that I published a [book of my Numerical Analysis lecture notes](https://www.fubinitonelli.it/numerica/)
- 🌱 I've been a social media manager for Fridays For Future at national level
- 🎥 I've been practising videomaking and photography for over 8 years

Enjoy my repositories!
